This Java-based client-server chat application utilizes sockets and multithreading to enable real-time communication between multiple clients. The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port and assigns a new thread to each connected client, ensuring seamless communication. The clients establish a connection with the server, allowing users to send and receive messages asynchronously. The server relays received messages to all connected clients except the sender, creating a real-time chat environment. Tools Used: Java Sockets are used for network communication between the server and clients. Multithreading enables the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously. Server socket & Socket Classes are used where ServerSocket listens for connections, while Socket establishes connections from clients. BufferedReader & PrintWriter handle input and output streams for message transmission. I/O Streams are used for reading and writing messages over the network. Threading in Java ensures that each client is managed by a separate thread on the server for concurrent message handling. This implementation ensures a fully functional multi-client chat application, supporting real-time messaging through a console-based interface
